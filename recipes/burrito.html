        <p>Burrito, a common cylindrical food item of Mexican and American origin consisting of a tortilla wrapped around a mixed
            filling of such ingredients as meat, cheese, beans, and vegetables.</p>

        <p>The burrito differs from the taco in that the circular tortilla in the latter case is simply folded, not wrapped.</p>
