        <p>Burrito, a common cylindrical food item of Mexican and American origin consisting of a tortilla wrapped around a mixed
            filling of such ingredients as meat, cheese, beans, and vegetables.</p>

        <p>The burrito differs from the taco in that the circular tortilla in the latter case is simply folded, not wrapped.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>beef burrito filling</li>
            <li>plain white rice</li>
            <li>corn</li>
            <li>black beans</li>
            <li>cabbage</li>
            <li>diced tomatoes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes until onion is lightly browned. 
                Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until it turns from red to brown.</li>
            <li>Add Taco Seasoning (or use 1 packet store bought) and cook for 1 minute. 
                Then add tomato paste and water, cook for 3 minutes until the water is mostly evaporated but the beef is still juicy, not dried out.</li>
        </ol>
